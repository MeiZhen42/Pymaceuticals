# Pymaceuticals Summary
Challenge_05

Pymaceuticals is studying the effects of certain drugs on tumor development in lab mice. Due to an error in data collection, one mouse has been omitted from the analysis (g989).

Based on the statistics asked, Infubinol and Ceftamin appear to increase tumor growth in vivo, whereas Capomulin and Ramicane reduce tumor growth. Additionally, it appears that Capomulin has reduced tumor size over the span of 35 days. Finally, tumor size appears to have a positive relationship with mouse weight.
